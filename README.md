# Wordle

This is an iPhone version of the popular game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) coded natively with Swift and SwiftUI. I created this from scratch to practice my Swift and SwiftUI skills, as well as to practice the MVVM Design Pattern.

# Example
Light Mode            |  Dark Mode
